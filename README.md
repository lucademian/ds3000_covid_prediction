### Description

For our project, we wanted to do something using COVD-19 data. At first, we were thinking of different unsupervised
project ideas about analyzing the factors which contributed to the pandemic spread in the United States. After review
we switched to thinking of supervised learning problems, and decided to attempt to develop a model to predict COVID-19
case count in a particular county based on several prior factors we identified. We decided to look at case count N days
after the first case recorded, to control for how the infection appeared non-uniformly throughout the states. We are
going to examine several different timelines, or N-day values.
